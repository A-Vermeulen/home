                <h3 class="headline scroll-animated-from-right">A bit about me</h3>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">I’m an entrepreneur: I would say that all companies that I have worked in were in an initial stage even the global ones. The American UCI Cinemas, the Italian TIM Telecom, the Danish Atchik-Realtime, The Brazilians LGR, and Edi, all of
                    them independent of budgets and size, were in a startup phase. I was born to manage areas and companies in this mood!.</p>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">A Digital Marketing and Social media strategist: The first time I have seen a social media community was in 2003 in blah! , a global brand from TIM. Since then I managed more than 10 social media communities branded by Telecom companies
                    and Atchik-Realtime: blah!, Oi Pegação, Claro Chat, Entel Chat among others. More than 20 million active users and all the crazy KPIs and engagement strategies to make it happen for years.</p>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">A geek-marketer: I love data, design, and innovative thinking. I did an MBA in Marketing and Innovation. For me, Marketing is precise information and good-sense with a spark of innovation. Ask me anything about bots, AI, Python, Pandas(not
                    the animals), and even machine learning models applied to boost engagement, sales, test marketing campaigns, and provide predictions. I can spend hours talking about that! Seriously!</p>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">I’m also a big believer in people. I have managed several teams in different cultures and organizational models. From the traditional project management to Agile approach, I come across very smart people from LATAM, Africa, Europe, and
                    Asia. A mix of cultures and behavior, motivations, and expectations. It was great and challenging managing so many diversity. Maybe what I most miss in all companies I have worked before.</p>
